# Boogeyman 3 — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Multi-stage case ko coherent report with confidence, impact and response decision points mein close karna.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- Timeline order is not automatically causality or attribution.
- Containment and recovery need explicit ownership and verification.
- A useful closeout includes detection gaps and lessons learned.

## Analyst lens

- Confirmed timeline, impact scope, containment/recovery actions and verification evidence.
- Residual risk, detection improvement and open tasks.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

Use one timeline row per material observation: UTC time | artefact/source | observed fact | interpretation | confidence | next action. Close with scope, impact, containment/recovery status, evidence gaps, detection opportunities and owner for each follow-up.

## Common traps

- Declaring complete remediation without validation.
- Omitting follow-up monitoring and control improvements.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- Which evidence supports closure?
- What should be monitored after recovery?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
