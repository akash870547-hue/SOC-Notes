# Log Analysis with SIEM — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **SIEM Triage for SOC**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Multiple log sources ko normalise, filter and correlate karke a reproducible story banana.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- Validate source/index, time range and field mappings first.
- Build simple searches incrementally and retain sample raw events.
- Use correlation keys carefully; user, host and IP may be reused or transformed.

## Analyst lens

- Query, index/data view, time range, raw records, join keys and result count.
- Late ingestion, null fields and source coverage.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

Example SPL (replace the placeholder with a dataset you are authorised to query):

```spl
index=<authorized_index> earliest=-24h
| stats count by sourcetype
| sort - count
```

Validate the index, time bounds and fields first; inspect representative raw events before relying on aggregations. For Elastic, record the data view and whether the query is KQL or DSL.

## Common traps

- Relying on a summary count without record review.
- Joining on a shared IP without NAT/proxy context.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- Can the query be repeated and interpreted?
- What source is missing from the timeline?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
