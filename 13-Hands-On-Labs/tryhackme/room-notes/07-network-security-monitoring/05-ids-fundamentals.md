# IDS Fundamentals — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **Network Security Monitoring**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Signature/anomaly alerts, rule logic, false positives and sensor placement ko samajhna.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- Signatures match patterns; anomaly models identify deviation, each with limitations.
- Sensor placement determines which traffic is visible.
- Tuning requires positive, benign and edge-case tests.

## Analyst lens

- Rule ID/version, packet or flow evidence, threshold, direction and sensor position.
- Known benign cases and missed-coverage risks.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

Wireshark display-filter reminders (apply to an authorised capture):

```text
dns
http.request
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
```

A command-line conversation summary can be generated with `tshark -r <authorized-capture.pcap> -q -z conv,tcp`. Preserve the original capture and note capture-point/packet-loss limitations.

## Common traps

- Raising thresholds only to make alerts disappear.
- Treating an IDS alert as a complete incident narrative.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- What is the rule intended to detect?
- What evidence validates or falsifies the alert?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
