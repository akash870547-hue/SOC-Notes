# Man-in-the-Middle Detection — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **Network Security Monitoring**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

TLS/certificate anomalies, ARP/DHCP changes and path context ko investigate karna.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- MITM indicators vary by protocol and network design.
- Certificate warnings, duplicate addresses and unexpected gateway changes need corroboration.
- Encrypted traffic limits content visibility but not all metadata.

## Analyst lens

- Certificate chain/hostname/time, ARP/DHCP records, endpoint warning and network path.
- Known proxy, VPN or inspection device context.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

Wireshark display-filter reminders (apply to an authorised capture):

```text
dns
http.request
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
```

A command-line conversation summary can be generated with `tshark -r <authorized-capture.pcap> -q -z conv,tcp`. Preserve the original capture and note capture-point/packet-loss limitations.

## Common traps

- Treating every certificate warning as interception proof.
- Ignoring legitimate TLS inspection or network changes.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- Which signal is independent corroboration?
- What trusted network configuration should be compared?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
