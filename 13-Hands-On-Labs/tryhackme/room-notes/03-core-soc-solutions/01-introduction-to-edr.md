# Introduction to EDR — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **Core SOC Solutions**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Endpoint telemetry, process ancestry and authorised response actions ke concepts ko connect karna.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- EDR records endpoint activity and supports detection/investigation.
- Parent-child process context is more useful than an executable name alone.
- Containment actions can disrupt business; follow approval and playbooks.

## Analyst lens

- Host/user, process tree, command line, file path/hash, network activity and event time.
- Action history and response status.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

Example SPL (replace the placeholder with a dataset you are authorised to query):

```spl
index=<authorized_index> earliest=-24h
| stats count by sourcetype
| sort - count
```

Validate the index, time bounds and fields first; inspect representative raw events before relying on aggregations. For Elastic, record the data view and whether the query is KQL or DSL.

## Common traps

- Calling a binary malicious solely because of its name.
- Isolating a host without considering scope and authorisation.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- Which telemetry would corroborate the process alert?
- What response is proportionate and authorised?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
