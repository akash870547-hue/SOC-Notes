# Systems as Attack Vectors — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **Blue Team Introduction**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Misconfiguration, exposed services, weak identity controls and unpatched software ko defensive risk ke roop mein dekhna.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- Attack surface includes identity, configuration, software, services and trust relationships.
- A vulnerability's presence does not prove exploitation.
- Prioritisation combines exploitability, exposure, asset importance and evidence.

## Analyst lens

- Affected host/service, version or configuration evidence, exposure and business criticality.
- Relevant authentication, process and network events around the time window.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

No tool output is a verdict by itself. Write the case ID, analyst, time window, source system, status, confidence, business impact and next owner. Keep facts, hypotheses and actions separate.

## Common traps

- Equating a scanner finding with a confirmed compromise.
- Applying remediation without owner/change-control context.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- What evidence distinguishes exposure from exploitation?
- Which context changes remediation priority?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
