# Humans as Attack Vectors — SOC L1 Field Notes

> Independent study sheet for **Blue Team Introduction**. This page is designed to help you understand the defensive skill and document your own observations; it is **not** an answer key or a room walkthrough.

## Room focus

Human-focused threats ko blame ke bajay observable behaviour, context aur usable controls se assess karo.

## Concepts to carry into the room

- Urgency, authority, unexpected requests and unusual payment/login changes are contextual cues.
- Sender display name is not proof of sender identity.
- Reporting paths and rapid containment can limit impact.

## Analyst lens

- Original sender address, authentication results, reply-to, URLs, attachment metadata and recipient report.
- Independent business context for unusual requests.

## A practical way to organise your own investigation

Use this as a general analyst workflow, not as a sequence of room-specific answers:

1. **Scope:** note the authorised lab/asset, time range, relevant identity or network entities, and the data source being examined.
2. **Observe:** record raw evidence and query/filter details before summarising it.
3. **Correlate:** connect records only when identifiers, timestamps and context support the relationship.
4. **Challenge the hypothesis:** seek a benign explanation and note what evidence is missing.
5. **Decide and communicate:** state the verdict with confidence, evidence, impact, next action and escalation owner.

## Tooling / reference notes

No tool output is a verdict by itself. Write the case ID, analyst, time window, source system, status, confidence, business impact and next owner. Keep facts, hypotheses and actions separate.

## Common traps

- Treating spelling mistakes as mandatory proof of phishing.
- Clicking links or opening attachments during first-pass review.

## Personal evidence worksheet

Fill this with **your own observations** from an authorised session. Avoid publishing flags, answers, or restricted room-specific details.

| UTC timestamp / range | Source or artefact | Observed fact (not interpretation) | Interpretation / confidence | Next pivot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ | _Fill in_ |

## Write-up prompts

- Which evidence is stronger than visual appearance?
- What should the recipient and SOC do next?

When you finish, write a short report with: **summary**, **scope**, **key evidence**, **verdict and confidence**, **benign alternatives considered**, **impact**, **response or escalation**, and **limitations / next steps**. Every material conclusion should point back to a source or observation.
